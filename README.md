# Language-Build-Network-Graphs-of-Wizards-and-Witches

We might be Muggles, but we have a different kind of magic in our hands—coding. Then again, if we did end up in Hogwarts, we’d probably all be in Slytherin because we can speak Parseltongue…

Because we code in Python, geddit? 

Ahem. 

Anyways, in this project, you will work with text data from all seven Harry Potter books. That is around 1.2M words, and close to 200 hundred chapters in total. You will perform data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, sentiment analysis, and finally network analysis. 

This project is going to be fun, whether you are a Harry Potter fan or not!
